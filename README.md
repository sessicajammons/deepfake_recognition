Instructions
1. Download the main.py file.
2. Open the file using Google Colab ipynb. 
3. Upload photos (real and fake) to the Google Colab local ipynb path. 
4. Run the main.py file.
5. When prompted, copy an uploaded photo path from the local ipynb path and paste the path into the prompt.
6. Press enter to allow the model to predict whether the photo is real or fake.
7. Once the user has no more photos to test, enter 'exit' into the photo upload prompt.
